# hello-world
My first repository

Im just following the tutorial, so here's a little bit about me. I'm learning to code for a hobby, I have just always been intrigued by programming and how things worked so I finally decided to take the step to learn for myself. Im currently learning c++ and will later get into Python. I don't know what I will use it for just yet but I would like to be apart of a project in the near future.
